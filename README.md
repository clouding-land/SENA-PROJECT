Problem Statement:
➢ Objective is to analyze and detect Fraudulent transactions among Legitimate ones. For this we make use of dataset from Kaggle for representing transactionsas a graph with
• Customers and merchants serve as Nodes
• Transactions serve as Edges.
• The Edges are weighed according to the amount of the transaction
• label of edge as "Fraudulent."
2. Dataset Description:
➢ The dataset is comprised of simulated card transactions. It contains both genuine and fake exchanges of clients with a pool of Vendors.
➢ This dataset was extracted from the Kaggle database.
➢ Dataset Attributes:
▪ index - Row ID
▪ cc_ num - Credit Card Number of the customer
▪ merchant - Merchant Name
▪ amt-Transaction Amount (in USD)
▪ is_ fraud -Target Variable. (0=genuine, 1=fraudulent)
➢ Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection
3. Tools used:
➢ Python: We have used the Python Language for the coding part because of its User-friendly Data Structures.
➢ NetworkX: The Python programming language's Network X package is used to create, modify, and research the structure, dynamics, and functionalities of complex graph networks.
➢ Google Colab: Google Colab is particularly well suited to machine learning, data analysis, and education since it enables anyone to develop and run arbitrary Python code through the internet. The cloud-based, open-source Jupyter Notebook, which provides free computing resources, is essentially another name for Google Colab. Python code may be written and run through a browser using Google Colab.
